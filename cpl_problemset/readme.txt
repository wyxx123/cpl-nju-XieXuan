This is the solution to CPL_problem set from Adam Xie (wyxx123) in NanJing university, Software Engineering.
As far as these problems are not included in the homework, and not accounted for scores, I will upload the codes after I work out every problems.

--You're welcome to:
  1. refer to my codes if you have no ideas to work out a problem yourself.
  2. find bugs in the codes I write.
  3. come up with better methods after reading my codes and share with me (or others).
  
--You're not expected to:
  1. copy my codes (don't do that, because that will just waste your time, no scorces, no improvement!)
  2. load it over me by mocking at the codes I have wrote (which is of high possibility because I'm just a 菜狗 (doge) )
  3. show off to others using my codes.
  4. using my codes in any website(CSDN, Stack Overflow, ect.) without telling me and noting the name of the author (wy_xx123).
  

Finally, have fun with coding!!!
